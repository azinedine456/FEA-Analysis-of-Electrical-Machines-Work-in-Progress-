# FEA Analysis of Electrical Machines using FEMM (Work in Progress)

This repository documents ongoing work related to **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** applied to various types of electrical machines. The project focuses on understanding the influence of design parameters, geometry, and winding configurations on machine performance.

---

## Project Objectives

- Gain a deeper understanding of **FEA techniques** and their application to electrical machines.  
- Study the impact of **motor design and geometry** on performance metrics such as torque ripple and cogging torque.  
- Analyze how **stator winding placement** and **pole geometry** influence the resulting EMF and overall control effectiveness.  
- Perform **FEA-based analysis** on **squirrel cage induction motors**.  
- Implement **Lua scripting for FEMM** through MATLAB for automated simulation and data extraction.  
- **Long-term objective:** Evaluate different software tools (e.g., *FluxMotor Student Suite*) to compare their strengths and weaknesses relative to FEMM, and develop a detailed **FEA model of an IPM-SynRM motor**.
